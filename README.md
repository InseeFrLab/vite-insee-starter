## Running locally

```env
git clone https://github.com/InseeFrLab/vite-insee-starter
cd vite-insee-starter
cp .env.sample .env.local
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Deploying the APP

You can use the Docker Image published here: https://hub.docker.com/r/inseefrlab/vite-insee-starter  
You have to set the environment variables:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://insee-todo-api.up.railway.app
VITE_OIDC_ISSUER=https://auth.code.gouv.fr/auth/realms/playground
VITE_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=vite-insee-starter
```

## Automatic publishing on Docker Hub

The CI of this starter automatically publishes on dockerhub under `<name of the github org>/<name of the repo>`

For it to work you must have set the GitHub Actions secrets:

```
${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
```

(It is configured in the option of the repo or the github org)

## The TODO rest API

For demoing this stack we created a simple todo app REST API.  
It's available here: https://github.com/InseeFrLab/todo-rest-api
and is deployed here: https://insee-todo-api.up.railway.app/doc

The client used to consume this API is automatically generated by Orval.  
You can refresh it for the currently published version of the API by running:

```bash
yarn generate-todos-api-client
```

## Keycloak theme

When authenticating you will notice that the login pages are DSFR themed.  
We're using the custom keycloak theme of the DSFR: [keycloak-theme-dsfr](https://github.com/codegouvfr/keycloak-theme-dsfr) 🐓.  
It has been created using [react-dsfr](https://react-dsfr.codegouv.studio/) and [Keycloakify](https://keycloakify.dev/).

## Why pushing tss-react over other styling solution?

You might think that tss-react isn't the more obvious choice and I'm just pushing it because we made it but here me out.  
It has approximately 900 000 downloads per month and is used by establish solution like [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) and
it integrates flawlessly with MUI. It's even [mentioned in the official MUI documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/migration/migrating-from-jss/#2-use-tss-react).

But more importantly. It's arguably the one of the most powerful styling solution. It enables to write styles as a function of the internal state of the component.  
It let you express sophisticated styling logic in a way that is easy to read and maintain.

It's drawback is that, as it's a dynamic styling solution (as opposed to statically extracted ones like tailwind), it's doesn't have the same performance and is not
compatible with Next.js Server Components. However at Insee we're building SPA and the performance hit is negligible (we're talking about a few milliseconds).
